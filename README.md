## :mag: Motivation

The idea to build this project started from a personal need to know how much time was left for an activity, and getting kind of disappointed by the existing solutions I found on the internet. This personal need inspired me to create this project. :hourglass:

Also, developing [TheCountdown](https://thecountdown.vercel.app/) was a great way to practice my development skills by creating and publishing an application from scratch, which would solve a real problem in the world!

## :rocket: Features

- Flexible, interactive countdown timers, from any date to any date
- Good user experience (UX) and visual feedback
- Simple, user-friendly, and intuitive interface
- Responsive layouts, both mobile-friendly and desktop-friendly
- Fast, lightweight, and easily accessible application on the internet

## :gear: Technologies

The main technologies and tools used in this project are the following:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> Deployed to [Vercel](http://vercel.com/)

## :computer: How to use

**TheCountdown** is available at [thecountdown.vercel.app](https://thecountdown.vercel.app/). Check it out if you'd like to give it a try! :wink:

## :bulb: Learning outcomes

Building this project has proven to be a great way to learn, practice, and acquire experience with lots of interesting technologies and tools. My main learning outcomes were related to:

- **Planning, designing, developing and deploying this application from scratch**. This includes going through possibilities, gathering resources, establishing priorities, responding to requirement changes and focusing on generating value for users.
- Providing a **good user experience** (**UX**), by creating a lightweight, simple, and useful application.
- Using **Agile methodologies**, in order to enhance the development efficiency and deliver high-quality upgrades incrementally.
- Applying development **best practices**, such as clean code, separation of concerns, KISS and DRY, which are meant to keep the codebase easy to understand, maintain and extend.
- Using **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**, which are modern frontend technologies employed in this project.
- Improving **performance** of components in **React**, and using **static generation** and **server-side rendering** with **Next.js**.
- **Manipulating dates and time ranges**, **storing the last countdown locally** for a later session, and using **gradients**.
- **Optimizing SEO** (Search engine optimization), in order to be better indexed by search engines.
- Using **analytics tools to understand user behavior** and apply this knowledge to prioritize future changes.
